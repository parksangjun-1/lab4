# [Lab 4] Memory System Simulation: Additional Guide

We added some more instructions as comments. Please check the files.

The instructions are there to help you understand. It's okay to implement it differently, as long as the functionality is correct.

We recommend using the files in this repository for reading and reference only. Copying and pasting the contents and pushing them to your repository is not recommended, due to potential conflicts.

Also, we provide a stat for Part II (single-level).
